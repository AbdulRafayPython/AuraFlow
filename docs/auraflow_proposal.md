PROJECT AREA/TOOLS
Tools Required:	•	Frontend: React.js (UI), TailwindCSS (styling), Chart.js/Recharts (graphs)
•	Backend: Flask (Python REST APIs), Socket.IO (real-time messaging)
•	Databases:
o	MySQL → Structured data (users, servers, channels, messages, moods, logs)
o	MongoDB (if needed) → Unstructured data (AI embeddings, uploaded files, large logs)
•	Caching/Performance: Redis (optional, for recent messages, typing indicators, online users)
•	AI/ML:
o	GPT API (summarizer, chatbot, message generation)
o	HuggingFace / TensorFlow Lite (sentiment & moderation models)
o	FAISS + LangChain (document-based Q&A support agent)
o	Google Translate API (for Roman Urdu → English translation in Mood Tracking Agent)
Area/Specialization:	Full-Stack Development, Real-Time Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED PROJECT (MAXIMUM 400 WORDS)

Today, platforms for communication such as Discord or Slack serve the purpose for which they were made. However, they do not integrate Emotion Understanding, multi-user agent collaboration, or even context awareness. We aim to fill this void with our Project AuraFlow which proposes an AI Enhanced Real-time Communication Platform that integrates collaboration and intelligent assistance. The system still maintains functioning chat boxes, but goes beyond traditional messaging with the addition of AI Agents that include, but are not limited to, the Summarizer Agent that generates conversation briefs on a daily basis, the Smart Moderation Agent that automatically detects and flags toxic content, AI Assistants for queries and automated responsese, and Mood Tracking Agents that analyze user sentiment in English and Roman Urdu, tracking the data in MySql and generating emotional dashboards. Other agents that focus on user productivity and well being include but are not limited to: Translator, Engagement, Wellness and Knowledge Builder. Our platform is built with Flask for the backend is and React.js for the frontend. Structured and unstructured data is handled by MySql and MongoDBwhile communication in real-time is done through Socket.io. Redis caching increases the scalability of the system. AuraFlow stands out by incorporating chat, emotional AI, and productivity analysis, and is thus able to offer unprecedented value in assisting students.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE(S)/OUTCOMES 
•	Build a real-time chat system (Flask + React.js + Socket.IO)
•	Secure JWT authentication with role-based access (admin, moderator, user)
•	Store structured chat data in MySQL and unstructured in MongoDB
•	Implement AI Agents, including:
o	Summarizer Agent → GPT/Gemini-powered chat summaries
o	Smart Moderation Agent → NLP-based toxicity detection + auto warnings
o	AI Assistant Agent → Q&A, jokes, and general chatbot
o	Auto Message Generator Agent → welcome messages, quick replies
o	Context-Aware Support Agent → vector-based Q&A on docs
o	Translator Agent → multilingual chat in real time
o	Mood Tracking Agent → sentiment analysis in English & Roman Urdu + graphs
o	Focus/Distraction Agent → detects productivity drops, suggests focus mode
o	Engagement Agent → polls, motivational prompts, icebreakers
o	Wellness Agent → break reminders for healthy digital habits
o	Knowledge Builder Agent → auto-FAQ creation from chat patterns
•	Develop dashboards in React.js for mood trends, moderation logs, and engagement reports
•	Optimize chat with Redis caching for scalability
